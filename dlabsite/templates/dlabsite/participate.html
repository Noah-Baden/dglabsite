			<h3>What to Expect</h3>
			<p>The clinical research assistant will meet you in the lobby of the East Building.
				The study you are participating in will be further explained to you, you will be screened for
				eligibility, and consent documents will be signed. Questionnaires and other study documents
				will be completed at this time. If the study in which youâ€™re participating involves MRI scanning,
				a mock scan will be completed first. This is a simulation of the real MRI scan. It provides an
				opportunity to see the scanning environment and get a better understanding of what a real scan is
				like. We are then able to determine if you will tolerate lying still for the scan
				portions of the study.</p>
			<p>The study team wants you to be as comfortable as possible. We have snacks and drinks available
				to you. We try to be as flexible as possible with scheduling study visits. In addition, please
				remember that your participation is entirely voluntary and you may quit at any time or omit portions
				of the study. We are excited to have you participate!</p>

			<h3>MRI Scanning</h3>
			<p>If you are participating in a study that includes MRI scanning, please wear comfortable clothing
				without a belt or metal studs in the back. Remember to remove all metal from your body, including
				jewelry and hair accessories.</p>
			<p>The MRI scans do not include radiation, sedation, or anesthesia. You will be required to fill out an
				<a target="_blank" href="{% static 'dlabsite/other_resources/MRI_Screening_Form.pdf' %}">MRI safety
				screening questionnaire</a> to determine if it is safe for you to be scanned.
				The study staff will ensure that you are as comfortable as possible during your scanning session.
				Earbuds are provided to minimize the sound levels of the scanner and allow voice communication with
				the scanner operator. You are asked to lie flat on a padded surface with pillows, sheets, and blankets
				for comfort. We try to ensure participants are as comfortable as possible. You are able to inform the
				scanner operator of any discomfort during the scan.</p>
			<p>During a portion of the scans, you may watch a movie. We have a fairly wide selection of movies from
				which to choose, you may bring your own movie (no Blu-rays), or choose something from Netflix.</p>
